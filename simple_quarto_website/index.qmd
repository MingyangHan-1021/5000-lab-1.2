# about me (h1)

## about myself (h2)

I studied Computer Science and Information at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University from 2021 to 2023. In the autumn semester of 2023, I transferred to the University of Liverpool and obtained a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in July 2025. This autumn, I came to Georgetown University in the United States and enrolled in the DSAN program. Since I was a child, I have been fascinated by data and have been eager to explore and solve complex problems in the real world through data science and artificial intelligence methods.

Linear regression : $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \epsilon$

Normal distribution:    
$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}}
$$

> **Note:** Inserting formulas was also challenging. I consulted AI for assistance to help me modify the structure of this formula.
